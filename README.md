# ar2019
The lab I project: AR recognition Encyclopedia, which is developed by Unity 3D 2019.3.9f1 &amp; Android Studio.

Our project is to make children better aware of objects around them by developing an AR application prototype.

Based on our cultural background, we hope our program can help children understand Chinese culture to some extent.
So we want to create a program to introduce our country pictures of plants or parts of animals used in Chinese medicine
